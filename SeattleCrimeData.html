	<h1>Seattle Crime Data Analyis</h1>
	<div>
		For the final project of the first semester of my data science certificate, I analyzed a database of police reports for the city of Seattle dating from 2008 through August 2017.

<div id="textblock_1"> 
The City of Seattle is broken up into five precincts: North, West, East, Southwest, and Southeast.
Each of those precincts have a number of sectors, denoted by a letter. For example, 'M' is downtown Seattle. Each of those sectors has a number of beats denoted by a letter-number pair. M1 is then one of the beats in the M sector.

For this analysis, I decided to look at the sector level. There's enough of them that there's variation over the city, but not so many that the number would get overwhelming.

One thing I fif was a linear regression on the crime rate in each sector of the city from the beginning of 2008 to fall 2017.

South Lake Union and South Seattle are seeing a reduction in the fraction of crimes occurring in the city which are committed there, whereas downtown and North Seattle have a trend of more and more of the crime share shifting to them.

Next one on the fitting crime rate to a daily cycle. I decided to stick with more recent data - 2016 and 2017 data - since that provides enough data to make a fit on a sector level and I wanted to keep it up to date.

What did I do?

Show the graphs:

Can see that district M, downtown, has a majorly different cycle than other places.

Caveats to point out - spike in crime count as 12am and 12midnight - probably just "sometime during the day" and "sometime at night"

Data analysis, not really prediction?
